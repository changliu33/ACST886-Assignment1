### part(a)
The loan repaid is the same as the instalment we get from question 1.

L<-600000
instal<-32622.8
int<-0.035
L_rep<-instal
L_rep
```

```{r}
Loan_offset<-100000
Loan_oust<-L
for (i in 1:30) {
  if(Loan_oust>Loan_offset+instal){
    
    Interest_repaid<-(Loan_oust-Loan_offset)*int
    Loan_repaid<-L_rep-Interest_repaid
    Loan_oust<-Loan_oust-Loan_repaid
  }else{break("This is the second last payment")}
  
}
final<-Loan_oust*(1+int)-Loan_offset*int-Loan_offset
cat("NO.of payment:",i)
